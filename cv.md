## About Me

I am an experienced architect with over five years in the field, currently working as a project architect on projects like a medical center extension. I also manage a startup, where I’m developing my leadership and organizational skills.

  

I am passionate about innovation, continuous learning, and exploring new ideas across architecture, design, CGI, and software engineering. I’m searching for a way to combine these skills into a career that inspires me. I’m a fast learner who dives deep into subjects to build a strong foundation, and I’m committed to growing in any field I choose.

  

With some startup ideas in mind, I’m focused on gaining the knowledge and skills to bring them to life.
